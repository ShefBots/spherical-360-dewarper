More detailed usage instructions will be coming soon, for now please refer to the [ShefBots PiWars blog post](https://shefbots.github.io/vision/camera/2020/03/16/making-round-images-flat-and-flat-images-round.html) about it.

### Versioning Convention
Versioning in the format `Major.minor.bugfix`, where `Major` is the major version - incremented when a major milestone update is
perfomed and backwards-compatability is no longer guaranteed, the `minor` version increments as individual features are implemented,
and `bugfix` increments as bugs in that version are fixed.
