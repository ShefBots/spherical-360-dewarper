### Versioning Convention

Versioning in the format `Major.minor.bugfix`, where `Major` is the major version - incremented when a major milestone update is
perfomed and backwards-compatability is no longer guaranteed, the `minor` version increments as individual features are implemented,
and `bugfix` increments as bugs in that version are fixed.
